This repo is forked from: https://github.com/kashif-nawaz/Contrail_Networking_Canonical_Openstack_Functionality_Test

It adds an ansible wrapper to the establishment and teardown of Heat Stacks.

It adds: some playbooks to test the state in the Contrail API that describes the newly created stack.  Also if a management network is available it automates connectivity testing between the instantiated VMs.
